    "# Expressions containing NDArray objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python-Blosc2 implements a powerful way to operate with NDArray arrays and other objects, called \"lazy expressions\".  A lazy expression is a lightweight object which stores a desired computation symbolically, with references to its operands (stored on disk or in memory), but does not execute until data is explicitly requested, e.g. if a slice of the computation result is requested. The lazy expression will then execute, but only on the necessary portion of the data, making it especially efficient, and avoiding large in-memory computations.\n",
