    "\n",
    "Blosc2 leverages the power of NumPy to perform operations efficiently (with minimla memory footprint and execution time) on compressed multidimensional arrays. By compressing data with Blosc2, it is possible to reduce the memory and storage space required to store large datasets, while maintaining fast access times. This is especially beneficial for systems with memory constraints, as it allows for faster data access and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explore how Python-Blosc2 can efficiently perform a special class of particularly costly computations called *data reductions* (e.g. ``sum``, ``mean``), which are especially common in data science, by leveraging the benefits of the compression-first NDArray object. We'll also dive into further tuning the performance of these operations by using different chunk shapes, compression levels and codecs.  Finally, we will compare the performance of Python-Blosc2 with NumPy.\n",

Also, this notebook has been run on a CPU (Intel 13900K) with a relatively large L3 cache (36 MB). As it turns out, performance in Blosc2 is very sensitive to the CPU cache size, and the results may vary on different CPUs."

NDArray arrays are compressed, and we can choose how this compression is done during conversion by defining compression parameters: number of threads, compression levels, codecs, and chunk sizes. We will do a grid search over different combinations of these parameters to see how it affects performance. To do this, let's write a function that runs through the different compression combinations and performs the reductions over the different axes, for a fixed chunk shape (later on we'll vary the chunk shape too)."

    "There are a couple of things to comment on in the plot. The first is that, when reducing along all axes, Blosc2+LZ4+SHUFFLE actually achieves better performance than NumPy, showing the benefit of chunking and compression when working with large arrays which take up a significant fraction of memory. See later for a discussion on these results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second observation we can make is that, disappointingly, reductions along the X axis are much slower than those along the Y and Z axis for the Blosc2 case. This is because the automatically computed chunk shape is (1, 1000, 1000) making the overhead of partial sums larger for summing along the X axis. Why? If one sums along the Y axis for example, upon decompressing and summing a chunk of shape (1, 1000, 1000), one is left with a chunk of shape (1, 1000) that is already filled with the values of the final result. On the other hand, the same step, when summing along the X axis, results in a chunk of shape (1000, 1000) that then must be updated with the sum of the next chunk along the X-axis, and so on and so on. This is explained in more detail below, but it should be clear that the performance difference is due to the chunk shape being different along the different axes.\n",

Hence, for the 3D case above (shown schematically in the figure), the default chunk shape, shown in pink, is (1, 1000, 1000). While chunking the data like this often speeds up computations and operations, in the case of reductions, it means that reduction times along different axes will not be the same, as the sizes are not uniform.\n",

Since the chunk shape is isomorphic, no axis is preferred and hence the performance is similar for all of them.\n",

    "\n",
    "When compression is not applied, data is stored and accessed as-is, which saves the time spent on compression and decompression; however, especially if the data is large, the resulting higher memory usage can result in longer access times. Compression reduces the size of the data in memory and storage, which can improve performance when reading and writing data; but one then requires additional CPU time for compression and decompression. Therefore, it is important to find the right balance between reduced size and processing time to give overall optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the plots above, we can see how using the LZ4 codec is striking such a balance, as it achieves the best performance in general, exceeding the performance for uncompressed data. This is because LZ4 is tuned towards speed, and the time to compress and decompress the data is very low. On the other hand, ZSTD is a codec that is optimized for compression ratio, but is consequently a bit slower.  However, it is still faster than the uncompressed case, as the reduced memory transmission time compensates for the additional CPU time required for compression and decompression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have just scraped the surface for some of the compression parameters that can be tuned in Blosc2.  You can use the `CParams` object with the different parameters in [CParams reference](https://www.blosc.org/python-blosc2/reference/autofiles/storage/blosc2.CParams.html#blosc2.CParams) to set the compression level, codec, filters and other parameters.  We also offer automated parameter selection via the [Btune neural network tool](https://ironarray.io/btune) that, depending on your requirements for compression/decompression speed, compression ratio, or lossiness of compression, tries to select the best parameters for your application and CPU resources."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the balance between minimising storage space and the additional time required to process the data is important. Testing different compression settings can help you obtain the best trade-off between reduced size and processing time. However, as a first approximation (without requiring the user to weigh up the particulars of their CPU cache structure), the default Blosc2 parameters are not too bad, since the chunk shape is automatically selected based on the CPU cache size. As we have seen, it is also easy to fine tune the chunk shape if necessary for our desired application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the ``sum`` reduction examined here, Blosc2 supports the main reduction operations (``mean``, ``std``, ``min``, ``max``, ``all``, ``any``, etc.), and you are invited to [explore them](../../reference/reduction_functions.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we didn't review it explicitly here, it is possible to use reductions even for very large arrays that are stored on disk, as is the case for the lazy expressions and functions we have seen in previous tutorials. This is immensely powerful for data analysis on large datasets, offering efficient computations on datasets that are compressed on-disk with minimal memory usage. We will explore this in a forthcoming tutorial."
