    "# Advanced Lazy Expressions and Persistent Reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to more fully detail Blosc2â€™s capabilities for lazy computation in Python. In previous tutorials we have hinted at the power of lazy expressions, and in this tutorial we'll demonstrate exactly how lazy expressions optimize performance by deferring computations. Postponing the computation of the expression until it is actually needed means we can avoid large in-memory temporaries, optimizing memory usage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as mentioned previously, reductions are always computed eagerly when using regular Python expressions with Blosc2 operands. Thus, imprudent use of them could render the lazy expression technique ineffective. Fortunately Blosc2 implements a method to avoid eager computations even when calculating reductions by using a string version of the expression in combination with the `blosc2.lazyexpr` constructor. We will show how to create and save a lazy expression in this way, and then compute it to obtain the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also provide some examples which show how powerful broadcasting can be in Blosc2, and how we can use it to get metadata about the result of a lazy expression without performing the full computation. Access to structural information of the computation result, such as shape and dtype, is hence rapid - even for arbitrarily large arrays. Finally, we'll demonstrate how such metadata will dynamically adapt to changes in the dimensions and values of the original operands, stored on disk.\n",

By deferring the computation of expressions until necessary, Blosc2 can quickly access structural information about the result, such as the `shape` and `dtype`, even when operands **change** on disk, without performing intensive calculations. We can also avoid memory-starving temporaries, freeing up resources for the truly necessary computation steps. Broadcasting support also facilitates working with arrays of different sizes offering a powerful and intuitive interface for defining expressions.\n"
