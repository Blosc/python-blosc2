    "# Persistent reductions and broadcast in Lazy Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we’ll explore Blosc2’s capabilities for lazy computation in Python. We’ll create arrays of various dimensions, operate them using operations like reduction, addition and multiplication, and demonstrate how lazy expressions defer computations to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lazy expression technique is efficient because it postpones the computation of the expression until it is actually needed, removing the need for large temporaries and hence, optimizing memory usage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, reductions are kind of an exception in computing lazy expressions, as they are always computed eagerly when using regular Python expressions with Blosc2 operands. Fortunately, we can avoid eager computations by using a string version of the expression in combination with the `blosc2.lazyexpr` function. We will show how to create and save a lazy expression, and then compute it to obtain the desired results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll also see how resizing operand arrays is reflected in the results, highlighting the flexibility of lazy expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without further ado, let’s dive into lazy computation, reductions and broadcasting with Blosc2!"
