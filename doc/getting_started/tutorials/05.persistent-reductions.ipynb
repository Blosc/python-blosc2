    "# Advanced Lazy Expressions and Persistent Reductions\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to more fully detail Blosc2â€™s capabilities for lazy computation in Python. In previous tutorials we have hinted at the power of lazy expressions, and in this tutorial we'll demonstrate exactly how lazy expressions optimize performance by deferring computations. Postponing the computation of the expression until it is actually needed means we can avoid large in-memory temporaries, optimizing memory usage and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as mentioned previously, reductions are always computed eagerly when using regular Python expressions with Blosc2 operands. Thus imprudent use of them could render the lazy expression technique ineffective. Fortunately Blosc2 implements a method to avoid eager computations even when calculating reductions by using a string version of the expression in combination with the `blosc2.lazyexpr` constructor. We will show how to create and save a lazy expression, and then compute it to obtain the desired results."

    "The dynamic adaptation of lazy expressions to changes in the dimensions of array operands illustrates the power of deferred computations in Blosc2. By deferring the computation of expressions until necessary, Blosc2 can quickly access structural information like the `shape` and `dtype`, even when operands **change** on disk, without performing intensive calculations. We can also avoid memory-starving temporaries, freeing up resources for the necessary computation steps. Broadcasting support also facilitates working with arrays of different sizes, making the process more powerful and intuitive.\n"
