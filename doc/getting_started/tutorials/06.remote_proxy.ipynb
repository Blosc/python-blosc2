Before accessing the data, `__getitem__` calls `fetch` to ensure that the necessary chunks are in the cache. If the data is not present in the cache, `fetch` takes care of downloading it from its original location (for example, from disk or an external source). This ensures that when `__getitem__` performs the indexing operation, it has immediate access to the data without interruptions.\n",
