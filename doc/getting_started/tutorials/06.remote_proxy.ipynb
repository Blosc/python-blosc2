    "# Using Proxies for Efficient Handling of Remote Multidimensional Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with large datasets, a common problem is that they must be stored remotely, or on-disk, since they are too large to fit in memory. Doing so frees up memory for calculations with the data, but transfer times between the processor and the stored data can then cause bottlenecks. Blosc2 offers a way to manage this via proxies, and thus obtain the typical speedups associated with caching and in-memory storage of data, whilst still storing the dataset remotely/on-disk. This means we can mitigate the trade-off between storage space and execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will look at how to access and cache data for calculation using the `fetch` and `__getitem__` methods implemented in the ``Proxy`` class, the main Blosc2 proxy implementation. Through this comparison, we will gain a better understanding of how to optimize data access, as measured by the execution time of these retrieval operations. We will also measure the size of the local proxy file, to verify the efficiency of data management and storage. Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of data caching!"

    "## ``C2Array`` class\n",
    "Before we look at proxies, it is first necessary to understand how to use Blosc2 to work with remote data, via the ``C2Array`` class. The class implements a (limited) version of the NDArray interface of which we have already seen a lot in previous tutorials. However, it is really a local pointer to a remote array (stored e.g. on a remote server). This means that we can refer to the data, access certain attribute information about it, download portions of the data and even define it in computational expressions, without having to download the entire array into local memory or disk. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets that cannot fit into memory or would take far too long to transfer over the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one limitation of this approach is that every time one wants to download a slice of the dataset, the data is fetched over the network - even if the same slice has been downloaded before. This can lead to inefficiencies, especially when working with large datasets or when the same data is accessed multiple times. Proxies offer a solution to this, whilst still preserving the low storage requirements of the ``C2Array`` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proxy Classes for Data Access\n",
    "The [``Proxy`` class](../../reference/proxy.rst) in Blosc2 is a design pattern that acts as an intermediary between a (typically local) client and (typically remote or on-disk) real data containers, enabling more efficient access to the latter. Its primary objective is to provide a *caching mechanism* for effectively accessing data stored in remote/on-disk containers that utilize the ``ProxySource`` or ``ProxyNDSource`` interfaces, which serve as templates for defining custom proxy classes - in themselves they cannot be used directly, as they are abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to define our own ``MyProxySource`` proxy class that will inherit from and implement the ``ProxyNDSource`` interface; it will be responsible for downloading and storing only the requested chunks, progressively filling the cache as the user accesses the data."

    "The ``Proxy`` class implements two methods to retrieve data: ``fetch`` and ``__getitem__``. Similar to the  ``NDArray`` methods ``slice`` (returns ``NDArray``) and ``__getitem__`` (returns NumPy array) ``fetch`` returns an ``NDArray`` and ``__getitem__`` a NumPy array. However, there are more differences, which we'll now detail.\n",

    "``fetch`` is designed to return the full local proxy (with shape the same as the source data), which serves as a cache for the requested data. The cache is initialized with zeros in all entries, before the first ``fetch`` call; when ``fetch`` is called with a specific slice, the required chunks are downloaded from the remote source and used to populate the relevant entries in the local proxy container; the remaining entries remain uninitialized with zeros. If ``fetch`` is called again with a different slice, only the new chunks necessary to fil out the new slice are downloaded to fill the relevant entries of the cache. If the same slice is requested again, the data is already present in the local proxy cache, so the cache is returned immediately with no download occurring.\n",

Before accessing the data, `__getitem__` calls `fetch` to ensure that the necessary chunks are in the cache.

Firstly, often one wants to access multiple slices of large remote arrays within a script, and thus slices may overlap with already-downloaded chunks from a previous ``fetch``; by fetching the whole chunk in the first slice, one already has the data locally for future slice commands, thus implementing an efficient data **prefetcher**.  Secondly, by sending the whole (compressed) chunk, the data is always compressed during the complete workflow (file transfer and storage), which reduces storage space, file transfer time, and processing overheads."
