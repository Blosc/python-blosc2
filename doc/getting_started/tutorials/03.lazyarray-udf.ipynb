    "Now, let's define our function, which will be the executable attribute of a ``LazyUDF`` object. Internally, ``LazyUDF`` will execute the function chunkwise on the operands when requested, and will expect the function to have a signature with three parameters: 1) an inputs tuple; 2) an output buffer to be filled; and 3) the chunk offset coordinates. When the function is called by ``LazyUDF``, the inputs tuple will contain chunks of the operands, and must fill the output buffer with the computation result (which is automatically of the correct shape and dtype due to the internal mechanics of ``LazyUDF``). The offset is the coordinates of the chunk being filled in the output, which is often useful (but not always necessary). For example, if we were to write a function to fill an empty array with ones on the main diagonal chunk-by-chunk, some chunks may have all zeros, which one will be able to ascertain using the coordinates in the offset parameter (see the implementation of [``blosc2.eye``](../../reference/ndarray.html#blosc2.eye)).\n",
