What is Python-Blosc2?
=======================

Python-Blosc2 is a high-performance compressed ndarray library with a flexible
compute engine, using `C-Blosc2 <https://www.blosc.org/c-blosc2/c-blosc2.html>`_
as its compression backend. It allows complex calculations on compressed data,
whether stored in memory, on disk, or over the network (e.g., via
`Caterva2 <https://github.com/ironArray/Caterva2>`_).  It uses the
`C-Blosc2 simple and open format
<https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc2/blob/main/README_FORMAT.rst>`_ for storing
compressed data.
